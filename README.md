# Natural-Language-processing-NLTK-spam-filtering
Here, I tried to classify spam or ham by using dataset from UCI repository. Dataset(SMS corpus) comprises of collection of sms. Here, I implemented CountVectorizer and TF-IDF transformer in pre-processing stage. For classification, I used Naive Bayes and SVM classifier. From result, it is observed that SVM classifier performs better than Naive Bayes for this dataset.
