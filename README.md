# Natural-Language-processing-NLTK-spam-filtering
Here, I tried to classify spam or ham by using dataset from UCI repository. Dataset(SMS corpus) comprises of collection of sms. Here, I implemented CountVectorizer and TF-IDF transformer in pre-processing stage. For classification, I used Naive Bayes and SVM classifier. From result, it is observed that SVM classifier performs better than Naive Bayes for this dataset. My code looks lengthy due to EDA and me trying to understand work of each functions. However, reader can ignore some unnecessary code lines.
